=== Use a CTE to display the first account opened by a district.

`*_Answer step by step:_*`

First I will output the simplest way to answer this, according to me:
To find the first account opened by a district, in the `account` table we have the key ingredients: `district_id`, `date`. Now, with the help of the `RANK()` function we can give an order or a rank to rows. This time the key column for this is `date`. 

So many accounts can be opened in one particular day so this is why RANK is usefully here. We can make windows or groups of district_id and order by date. If a date repeat, it will be given the same rank. So we will output the or the accounts ordered by rank date, so rank 1 would the the first account or accounts of a given district, then we can filter only the rank number on of each district:


```sql
SELECT
    district_id,
    account_id,
    date,
    rank() over (
        PARTITION by district_id
        ORDER BY
            date
    )
FROM
    account;
```

Now all we need to do is to use this query as our CTE so we can properly output the report and filtering the rank 1 accounts:

```sql
WITH cte_1 AS(
    SELECT
        district_id,
        account_id,
        date,
        rank() over (
            PARTITION by district_id
            ORDER BY
                date
        ) AS acc_op_rank
    FROM
        account
)
SELECT
    a2 AS district,
    account_id,
    `date` AS first_account_opening_date
FROM
    cte_1 ct
    INNER JOIN district d ON ct.district_id = d.a1
WHERE
    acc_op_rank = 1
ORDER BY
    1;
```

=== In order to spot possible fraud, we want to create a view **last_week_withdrawals** with total withdrawals by client in the last week.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS last_week_withdrawals;
```
```sql
CREATE VIEW last_week_withdrawals AS WITH cte_1 AS (
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        trans
    WHERE
        date BETWEEN (
            SELECT
                max(date) - 6
            FROM
                trans
        )
        AND (
            SELECT
                max(date)
            FROM
                trans
        )
        AND TYPE = "VYDAJ"

    client_id,
    sum(amount) AS total_withdrawals

=== The table `client` has a field `birth_number` that encapsulates client birthday and sex. The number is in the form `YYMMDD` for men, and in the form `YYMM+50DD` for women, where `YYMMDD` is the date of birth. Create a view `client_demographics` with `client_id`, `birth_date` and `sex` fields. Use that view and a CTE to find the number of loans by status and sex.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS client_demographics;
```

```sql
CREATE VIEW client_demographics AS
SELECT
    client_id,
    CASE
        WHEN SUBSTRING(birth_number, 3, 2) > 50 THEN CONCAT(
            SUBSTRING(birth_number, 1, 2),
            SUBSTRING(birth_number, 3, 2) -50,
            SUBSTRING(birth_number, 5, 2)
        )
        ELSE birth_number
    END AS dob,
    CASE
        WHEN SUBSTRING(birth_number, 3, 2) > 50 THEN 'F'
        ELSE 'M'
    END AS gender
FROM
    client;
```

```sql
SELECT
    client_id,
    dob,
    date_format(
        str_to_date(dob, '%y%m%d %H:%i:%s'),
        '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s'
    ) AS dob2,
    gender
FROM
    client_demographics;
```
